      You may re-tweet the original article, share it on Facebook,
      Reddit, Hacker News, etc.,
      post a comment to it, or do something similar, which will
      attract readers to it.
      Your repost will be reviewed by the post author before you get
      your reputation points.
      The repost may be rejected and this decision is made solely by the
      post author, and it's not disputable.
